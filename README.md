# Theta Sketch Decision Tree Classifier

A production-grade CART Decision Tree Classifier that trains on theta sketches but performs inference on raw tabular data. Designed for medical/market basket analysis scenarios with sklearn compatibility.

## Project Status

ðŸš§ **In Development** - Design Phase Complete

## Key Features

- âœ… Trains on theta sketches (privacy-preserving set summaries)
- âœ… Infers on binary tabular data (sklearn-compatible)
- âœ… Multiple split criteria (Gini, Entropy, Gain Ratio, Binomial, Chi-Square)
- âœ… Missing value handling (majority path method)
- âœ… Class weighting for imbalanced data
- âœ… Pre and post-pruning support
- âœ… Feature importance computation
- âœ… ROC/AUC metrics built-in

## Architecture

### Training Phase
- **Input**: CSV file with serialized theta sketches + YAML config
- **Process**: Build decision tree using sketch set operations
- **Output**: Trained tree structure

### Inference Phase
- **Input**: Binary feature matrix (0/1 values)
- **Process**: Tree traversal with missing value handling
- **Output**: Class predictions and probabilities

## Installation (Coming Soon)

```bash
# Not yet available - in development
pip install theta-sketch-tree
```

## Usage Example (Planned API)

```python
from theta_sketch_tree import ThetaSketchDecisionTreeClassifier
import numpy as np

# Training
clf = ThetaSketchDecisionTreeClassifier(
    criterion='gini',
    max_depth=10,
    verbose=1
)
clf.fit('sketches.csv', 'config.yaml')

# Inference on binary data
X_test = np.array([
    [1, 0, 1],  # Binary features
    [0, 1, 0],
])
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)
probabilities = clf.predict_proba(X_test)
```
